# SAR2Cube - A framework for an efficient setup of SAR imagery in analysis ready data cubes

This repository will collect the Jupyter Notebooks for the use cases and tutorials.
Currently the notebooks for the use cases have not been ported totally to openEO and therefore it is not possible to run them externally from Eurac.
